Weeks later watched another, halfway thru it glitched, I figured it was something with the disk.  Checked the disk- it looked new, tried a different BRAND NEW DVD and player still won't read it. Tried more dvds and still just get a \"\"No disk\"\" reading with any disk I tried. Total garbage. And now the return window has closed.  DO NOT BUY!\n",

    "- Review Text: I've only ever had 3 bad times out of thousands on Amazon and this is one. Long story short, its Chinese crap. Spend the extra $5's to get something much better. It skips sections in movies on occasion, the remote is odd, there are buttons that don't work, and its remote range is 3 feet. Also is oddly 'eats discs' like when it closes it was made wrong so it shoves the disc out of the player and 'crunches it'. Basically it slowly breaks discs.\n",

And if you press pause and then stop once, there's a 50/50 chance it will start where you left off. Additionally, I haven't had any issues with it playing discs or any of the other problems others have had. Update 1/24. If you're watching a series, plan on finishing the whole disc or watch one episode at a time. Whether you stop or pause, once ...\n",
